## Arduino-Game-Prototype

This prototype was created as a preliminary step to creating a portable video game system using a breadboard and Arduino Uno with a 4x4 LED display.

A writeup of the final project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ENAhj0HG9_NndMATqYdEILpIG5fCwfHf9Fn9IRsFxag/edit?usp=sharing).

This prototype contains an example of the first level of the game. You play as a block at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to avoid the falling blocks that come from the top of the screen. Over time, the blocks will fall faster. If you're hit, and end screen will show with a percentage of the screen filled to show how far you made it in the game.

The controls are as follows
- Left Arrow Key = Move Left
- Right Arrow Key = Move Right
- ENTER = Continue game
